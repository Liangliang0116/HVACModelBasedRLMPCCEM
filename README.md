# Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Building HVAC Control

This repository is the official implementation of [Building HVAC Scheduling Using Reinforcement Learning via Neural Network Based Model Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05313). 

## Requirements

To install requirements:
### Python package
```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### EnergyPlus
Please follow https://github.com/IBM/rl-testbed-for-energyplus and install EnergyPlus version 9.1.0

## Training

To run the PID agent, run

```train
python train_pid.py --city SF
```

To train the PPO agent, run

```train
python train_ppo.py --city SF
```

To train the model-based RL with random shooting (RS), run

```train
python train_model_based.py --city SF --mpc_horizon 5 --num_days_on_policy 10 --training_epochs 100
```

To train the model-based RL with dagger, run

```train
python train_model_based.py --city SF --mpc_horizon 5 --num_days_on_policy 10 --training_epochs 100 --dagger
```

It will create a folder called ``runs`` that includes all the state, action and rewards during the training.
The EnergyPlus generated files will be in the ``log`` folder.

### Available cities
- SF
- Golden
- Chicago
- Sterling

We also provide shell script file in case you want to run everything. Checkout
- run_pid.sh
- run_ppo.sh
- run_model_based_plan.sh
- run_model_based_dagger.sh
